      <p class="mb-4">My name is Amina. I’ve always loved languages and connecting with people, and English became a big part of my life as I grew up. It’s a language that helped me express myself, meet new people, and see the world differently.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">I’m patient, friendly, and easy to talk to, and I truly enjoy helping others learn step by step. I started teaching English because the language opened doors for me and gave me confidence, and I want to give that same feeling to others.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">My teaching style is unique because we don’t learn in a strict teacher-student way. We learn like a small friend circle. We talk about your interests, listen to songs and explore their meaning, read novels and analyze the characters, do fun challenges, games, and quizzes, watch short videos, and practice real conversations so the language feels natural instead of stressful.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">I can help anyone, whether you’re a beginner, a child, a teenager, or someone who simply wants to improve their English and speak with confidence.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">I love teaching because nothing compares to the moment a student suddenly understands something and feels proud of themselves. I especially enjoy helping people who feel shy or unsure, because I learned English slowly and patiently on my own, and I know exactly how that journey feels.</p>

      <p class="mb-8">My goal is to teach with empathy, clarity, and a warm atmosphere that makes you feel comfortable, supported, and excited to learn.</p>

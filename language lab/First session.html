        <ul class="mt-4 space-y-6 text-gray-700">
          <li>
            <strong>1. Where does the young man live?</strong><br>
            He lives in a garret, a small attic room in a five-storied house in S. Place.

          <li>
            <strong>2. Who lives on the floor below him?</strong><br>
            His landlady, who provides meals and services.

          <li>
            <strong>3. What feeling does he experience when he passes the kitchen?</strong><br>
            He feels sick, frightened, ashamed, and anxious.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <!-- LEVEL 2 -->
      <div class="mt-10">
        <h4 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Level 2 </h4>
        <ul class="mt-4 space-y-6 text-gray-700">
          <li>
            <strong>1. Why does he avoid the landlady?</strong><br>
            Because he owes her money and fears her questions or complaints.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2. How is his garret described, and what does it reveal?</strong><br>
            It is “more like a cupboard than a room,” suggesting poverty and isolation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>3. What does his fear of meeting her tell us about him?</strong><br>
            He is anxious and socially withdrawn, though not cowardly.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <!-- LEVEL 3 -->
      <div class="mt-10">
        <h4 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Level 3 </h4>
        <ul class="mt-4 space-y-6 text-gray-700">
          <li>
            <strong>1. If you were in his place in debt, how might you behave differently?</strong><br>
            Possible answer: communicate openly or repay part of the debt.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2. Imagine another person living in such a garret—what might their life feel like?</strong><br>
            Cramped, lonely, stressful, uncomfortable.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>3. How could his fear affect other relationships?</strong><br>
            He may avoid people and become socially anxious.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <!-- LEVEL 4 -->
      <div class="mt-10">
        <h4 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Level 4 </h4>
        <ul class="mt-4 space-y-6 text-gray-700">
          <li>
            <strong>1. How does Dostoevsky use the city to reflect his state of mind?</strong><br>
            The heat, smells, and crowded streets mirror his anxiety.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2. What contrast exists between his fear and the landlady’s behavior?</strong><br>
            She behaves normally; his fear is internal and psychological.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>3. What do small details reveal about social pressure?</strong><br>
            They show constant scrutiny and judgment.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <!-- LEVEL 5 -->
      <div class="mt-10">
        <h4 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Level 5 </h4>
        <ul class="mt-4 space-y-6 text-gray-700">
          <li>
            <strong>1. Is his fear reasonable?</strong><br>
            Reasonable due to debt, but exaggerated since she isn’t dangerous.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2. How effectively is tension created?</strong><br>
            Very effectively, through vivid setting and internal thoughts.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>3. Does the garret description create sympathy?</strong><br>
            Yes — it highlights his isolation and poverty.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <!-- LEVEL 6 -->
      <div class="mt-10">
        <h4 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Level 6 </h4>
        <ul class="mt-4 space-y-6 text-gray-700">
          <li>
            <strong>1. Rewrite the scene from the landlady’s perspective.</strong><br>
            Example: She thinks he is strange, unreliable, or troubled.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2. Imagine a modern version of this man.</strong><br>
            He might avoid crowded streets, worry about bills, and feel stressed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>3. Write a diary entry from his perspective.</strong><br>
            “July 3rd. The heat is unbearable. Passing the kitchen tightens my chest...”
          </li>
        </ul>
